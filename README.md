Creating a lottery script utilizing PHP as a part of school course

One of the final assignments of our course in uni was to create a lottery machine based on the PHP knowledge we've gained during the course.

My take on this was to create a form full of checkboxes the user can pick their numbers from. Then, the code takes the form input, raffles some random numbers and compares the two arrays to see if the user has "won".
